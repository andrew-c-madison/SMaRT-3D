# Semantic mapping through photogrammetry
The associated master branch houses python scripts for training and performing predictions with the VGG-16 fully convolutional neural network to perform semantic segmentation of RGB imagery. Segmented images may be applied to a photogrammetry work flow for automating point ploud classification and orthomosaic segmentation.
